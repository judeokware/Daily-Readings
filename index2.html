   <h2> FIRST READING</h2>
   
   <h3> “Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David.”

</h3>
   
   <h4>
      
      A reading from the first Book of Kings (1 KINGS 11: 29 - 32; 12: 19)
      
   </h4>
   
   <p>
      
      <pre>
         
         
         At that time, when Jeroboam
         went out of Jerusalem, 
         the prophet Ahijah the 
         Shilonite found him 
         on the road.
         Now Ahijah had clad
         himself with a new
         garment; and the two
         of them were alone in
         the open country.
         Then Ahijah laid hold
         of the new garment that
         was on him,and 
         tore it into 
         twelve pieces.
         And he said to Jeroboam,
         “Take for yourself ten pieces; 
         for thus says the Lord, 
         the God of Israel, 
         ‘Behold, I am about
         to tear the kingdom from 
         the hand of Solomon, and
         will give you ten
         tribes (but he shall
         have one tribe, 
         for the sake of my servant 
         David and for the sake of 
         Jerusalem, 
         the city which I have chosen 
         out of all the tribes 
         of Israel).
         ”’ So Israel 
         has been in rebellion
         against the house of
         David to this day.

   strange god among you,
   nor shall you worship 
    a foreign god.
   I am the Lord your God,
   who brought you up from the land of Egypt.

   But my people did not heed my voice,
   and Israel would not obey me.
   So I left them in their stubbornness of heart, 
   to follow their own designs.
   
    <b>
            <strong> R:</strong> I am the Lord, your God, listen to my voice.

   O that my people would heed me, 
   that Israel would walk in my ways! 
   At once I would subdue their foes,
   turn my hand against their enemies.

        He makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”

         A reading from holy
         Gospel according (MARK7:31 - 37)

      </h4>
      
      <pre>
         
         
      
         At that time: Jesus
         returned from the region of Tyre,
         and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee,
         through the region of the Decapolis.
         And they brought to him a man who was
         deaf and had an impediment in his
         speech; and they begged him to lay
         his hand upon him. And taking him
         aside from the multitude
         privately, he put his fingers into
         his ears, and he spat and touched
         his tongue; and looking up to
         heaven, he sighed, and said to him,
         “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.”
         And his ears were opened, his
         tongue was released, and he spoke
         plainly. And he charged them to
         tell no one; but the more he charged
         them, the more zealously they
         proclaimed it. And they were
         astonished beyond measure, saying,
         “He has done all things well; he
         even makes the deaf hear and the mute
         speak".
